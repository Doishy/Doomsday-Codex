## The data collection

## How the data is compiled

## Bias within the data

## Where this comes from

## The comparisons

## Extra data not listed

looking pretty good so far. There's so much content available from those stats and i wish we could put everything in. A couple suggestions just fro my first read through of your first draft:
I think when you talk about how "combo turn" is defined and you talk about how it could create some skew towards lower numbers you should more directly address how this is also the case with TES, as a t1 combo might not win til t4 if it's ETW.
Also, I think you should include a clearer section about caveats re: the data and how it compares to Cook's data. Among these the biggest ones are  1) that it was collected by many people (which you do address) but it means their playskill is unverifiable, 2) that the data is not all from MTGO Leagues and Comp-REL events, but from regular-REL paper events, MTGO Tournament Practice Room games, and even a handful of XMAGE and paper testing games. I'm honestly not sure how much that matters because I've run into some very bad opponents at Comp-REL, but worth noting. 3) that there is no control over what decklists people run, so there could be wild variation between lists and we might not know
Also worth addressing that our win% is below that of ANT or TES in Cook's article (but it has been trending upward)
and it's still a properly positive winrate
Also in the part where you compare which engines we use it might be worth breaking DD kills out into PTT and same-turn kills
since I think same-turn kills are the most common by a significant margin and that will sort of address the speed-data-skew aspect

## Closing thoughts
