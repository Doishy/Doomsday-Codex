Witty title for an article full of statistics:

Decks not hot.  
DDFT is international now fam.

## The Data Collection

Back in January I posted an [article](URL) detailing a bit about DDFT as a deck 
across the course of 2017 and how it is fairing now. I presented some
statistics that had been gathered and gave a hint that another article
was coming where I present them properly and in greater detail.  
This is that article.

Back in November some of us started trying to work out actually how the deck
was performing. We had gone through a tricky year with the Sensei's Diving Top ban and as a
result many people were changing many things in their lists with no real
idea of how performance was going. To help work this out we started a public
data collection sheet to facilitate working out a variety of stats. A lot
of influence for what data was to be gathered stemmed from the equivalent data
sheets and statistical work by Bryant Cook of TES fame. 

There are some key differences in how we have collected certain things. It
was assumed that DDFT of the three storm decks (ANT, DDFT, TES) was the slowest
and therefore unlike ANT/TES, we wanted to record combo turns up to T5+ as opposed
to T4+. The reasoning behind this is that T4 can often represent a combo turn on
T3 where the pilot has identified a piece of permission they must play around or similar.
Despite this difference in raw data for any direct comparisons to the ANT/TES data 
we have converted the results so that it's all incorporated into the T1-T4+ format.

```
Quick glossary:
ANT - Ad-Nauseum Tendrils, a Legacy Storm deck based around Past in Flames engine
DDFT - Doomsday Fetchland Tendrils, a Legacy Storm deck based around the card Doomsday
TES - The Epic Storm, a Legacy Storm deck based around Ad Nauseum and Burning Wish
Tendrils/ToA - Shorthand for Tendril's of Agony
Empty/EtW - Shorthand for Empty the Warrens
```

Winning game engines was another difference. We could have just tracked Doomsday
vs Empty the Warrens vs Natural Tendrils kills however this wouldn't have been enough detail.
Doomsday itself is a weird deck, once you cast the card there are so many different ways 
to draw into it, time it, win with it that you have a lot of different options.
In total we have 35 different generic winning engines used spread across the use of Doomsday, 
Burning Wish and the various win conditions that can be utilised. We also tracked whether
a combo turn involved a [pass-the-turn pile](URL), a [double cantrip pile](URL), and various
other techniques with cards like [Laboratory Maniac](URL) or [Conjurer's Bauble](URL).

Going into this level of detail allowed us to identify trends in how often the deck uses
what to win and how useful certain niche cards are to the deck.

contribute any and all matches played, just make sure to include all information requested
in the sheet.

## How the data is compiled

## Bias within the data

There are some limitations with how our data is compiled and assessed. One major one is
in regards to combo turn. Combo turn refers to the turn we "go off" but this may not be the same
turn we win. Casting Doomsday on T1 to build a [Shelldock Isle/Emrakul Pile](URL) would still
be recorded as a T1 combo turn despite not winning until T3/4. The same with early EtW plays. 
Making 14 Goblins on T2 might not win you the game until T4 or even later but it would still
be recorded as T2. The TES data has this same issue in regards to EtW lines but with Doomsday and
pass-the-turn piles it's possibly a bit more prevalent here.

Another major difference in the data collection compared to the TES data is that the TES data 
only draws from a single individual and only records MTGO Leagues or Comp REL paper events. We
decided to be a bit more open with our data collection compiling it from a large number of 
individuals at various sill levels and experience levels with the deck. This also includes practice
games, testing, local Paper events, Xmage and Cockatrice games. Despite some of the stigma associated
with some of these mediums they are all valid matches played in a competative fasion so should be counted.
It also allows us to generate the most amount of data points to try and avoid individual or medium biases
so that the deck's performance is the focus irrespective of skill level or experience.

The final main limitation is what decklists people are running. DDFT has a core series of pieces however
unlike a lot of decks, there are a lot of 'flexible slots' available in terms of numbers of Burning Wishes,
Lotus Petals, Lands, having BR duals vs all UR duals, whether you run Rain of Filth, Conjurer's Bauble,
Preordain, how many discard spells you run and at what ratios of each. Because of this variance
it's hard to determine what list is performing best. We could try at give each ratio of things a unique
code slot and string them together just as we could try and get people to list all cards in their piles
however people don't want to have to keep that level of detail in their notes so in the interests of
pragmatism this level of data is ommitted.


## Business business business. Numbers, numbers, numbers.

Right then, let's start looking at some data shall we?

First of all the number of total 'good' match data points is (NUMBER). A 'good' match is defined as one where
we have all the pertinent information recorded. For any data crunching involving sucess or win% we shall
also define a 'good' match as "not the mirror". The reason being here is that we might only have data from
one side of the match therefore only recording the result from one side and not the other. As a result it's
easier to just omit them than allow the minor skew from it to be used. So for any results based statistics
we had (NUMBER) data points instead (Yes, that means NUMBER mirror matches played, funtimes!).

### #Winning

First of all the one that everyone wants to know: The Match and Game win rates.

Match Win rate (%):  
Game Win rate (%):  

Well it's positive(>50%)! That's always a good start.  
What does this actually mean though?  

Well it means that we have a better than half chance of winning any given match against a 'normal' metagame
at least at face value. As you can see we have some interesting points in regards to the fact our game win %
is lower than our match win % and this will become more apparent as we go on. Long story short is that
we are favoured to win the less games we play. Most of our wins are 2-0's and most of our losses are 1-2's.

![Table]()

This is further justified when we look at our Match win % when we go to a game 3 compared to when we do not.

Match Win rate win in two games (%):  
Match Win rate win in three games (%):  

Looking further in again to a win % breakdown by game, we can see the trend even clearer:

Game 1 wins (%):  
Game 2 wins (%):  
Game 3 wins (%):

## The comparisons

## Extra data not listed

looking pretty good so far. There's so much content available from those stats and i wish we could put everything in. A couple suggestions just fro my first read through of your first draft:
I think when you talk about how "combo turn" is defined and you talk about how it could create some skew towards lower numbers you should more directly address how this is also the case with TES, as a t1 combo might not win til t4 if it's ETW.
Also, I think you should include a clearer section about caveats re: the data and how it compares to Cook's data. Among these the biggest ones are  1) that it was collected by many people (which you do address) but it means their playskill is unverifiable, 2) that the data is not all from MTGO Leagues and Comp-REL events, but from regular-REL paper events, MTGO Tournament Practice Room games, and even a handful of XMAGE and paper testing games. I'm honestly not sure how much that matters because I've run into some very bad opponents at Comp-REL, but worth noting. 3) that there is no control over what decklists people run, so there could be wild variation between lists and we might not know
Also worth addressing that our win% is below that of ANT or TES in Cook's article (but it has been trending upward)
and it's still a properly positive winrate
Also in the part where you compare which engines we use it might be worth breaking DD kills out into PTT and same-turn kills
since I think same-turn kills are the most common by a significant margin and that will sort of address the speed-data-skew aspect


Also, I'm not sure if you want to mention this anywhere, but another cool thing that DDFT has, is the ability to play high costed spells that ad nauseam decks cant. It's not really relevant now, but it may be in the future. I remember the insane builds with 4 Dig Through Time when it was legal. That was the most insane version I've ever played and I actually felt like DDFT was the best storm deck during that time
