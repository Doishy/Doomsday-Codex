2. 
Tell me the T2 kill from a board of LP, USea, Island and a hand of DR, DR, BS, PN, BW.

BS, AoI, LED, CB, GP
You use  CB to put LED on the bottom of the library

I have a real solution to your puzzle, but it requires maindeck ToA. Rit, Rit, BW, DD with B Floating, Island available. pile: [CB, LED, AoI, LED, ToA]. BS, leaving pile like this [AoI, PN, LED, ToA]. CB, LED, crack LED for RRR, crack bauble putting LED on the bottom. AoI into (PN, LED, ToA). Crack LED for UUU, the first ponder to grab the last LED, crack that for BBB, cast ToA.
it's a good argument for your maindeck ToA, since I don't think there is a pile without it
